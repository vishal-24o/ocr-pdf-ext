Motor Insurance PDF Data Extraction
Overview
This project extracts key information from Motor Insurance Policy PDFs and converts it into a structured JSON format following a strict predefined schema.
The solution is designed to handle non-uniform, semi-structured PDFs reliably and produce consistent output for downstream systems.

Problem Statement
Motor insurance policy documents are provided in PDF format and contain important customer, vehicle, policy, and premium details in varying layouts.

The objective is to:

Extract required fields accurately
Output a valid JSON object with all predefined keys
Ensure consistency, correctness, and robustness across different PDF in any format.
Output Schema
For every input PDF, the output must be one JSON object containing all keys listed below.

All keys must always be present
If a value is missing or not found, return an empty string ""
No additional or missing keys are allowed
Approach (WHAT WE WILL DO)
1. PDF Text Extraction
Read PDF content using a PDF parsing library
Use OCR if the PDF is scanned or image-based
2. Keyword-Based Detection
Identify fields using labels and keywords instead of fixed positions
This helps handle layout variations across different insurers
3. Field Mapping
Map each schema key to its corresponding keyword(s) in the PDF
Example:
POLICY_NO → “Policy No”
CUSTOMER_NAME → “Insured Name”
4. Data Cleaning & Formatting
Normalize date formats
Extract numeric values without extra text
Merge multi-line fields like addresses and nominee details
5. Missing Data Handling
If a field is not found, assign "" (null)
Ensure output structure is never broken
6. JSON Generation
Generate a valid JSON object
Maintain strict schema discipline
Key Features
Handles multiple PDF layouts
Strict schema enforcement
Clean and structured output
Safe handling of missing data
Easy to extend for similar documents
Error Handling
Extraction failures do not break JSON structure
Logs can be added for debugging missing or ambiguous fields
Success Criteria
Each PDF produces a complete JSON
Data is accurate and consistently formatted
Output can be directly consumed by analytics or business systems without manual correction :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
Future Enhancements
